To do list for co-channel experiments. 
- Compute scores for clean PLDA on co-channel data (SIR: 0 5 10 20 100)
- Compute scores for mixed PLDA 
    requires :
        - co-channel data in dev set. 
        - regenerating i-vectors for new dev set (on cluster)
- Write code for modified PLDA. 
- Rerun the same experiments performed in clean/mixed PLDA.
